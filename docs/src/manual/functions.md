# Simulation Modeling Functions

## Overview
Some of the most important features in a Monte-Carlo simulation package have to do with analyzing and applying correlation in models. MCHammer's correlation approach is based on *"Ronald L. Iman & W. J. Conover (1982) A distribution-free approach to inducing rank correlation among input variables, Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation"*
