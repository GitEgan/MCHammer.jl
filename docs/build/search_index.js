This tool is inspired by seminal tools such as Oracle Crystal Ball and Palisade @RISK for their ability to quickly build and analyze Monte-Carlo simulation models using Excel functions and automations. MC Hammer replicates their logic, functions and elemental tools in Julia, thus significantly reducing the time, lines of code, complexity and effort to perform advanced modeling and simulation.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Getting-Started-1","page":"MC Hammer v0r1","title":"Getting Started","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"MC Hammer v0r1","title":"MC Hammer v0r1","text":"In dev.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Tutorials-1","page":"MC Hammer v0r1","title":"Tutorials","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"MC Hammer v0r1","title":"MC Hammer v0r1","text":"Pages = [\r\n    \"tutorials/page1.md\",\r\n    \"tutorials/page2.md\",\r\n    \"tutorials/page3.md\"\r\n    ]\r\nDepth = 2","category":"page"},{"location":"#Another-Section-1","page":"MC Hammer v0r1","title":"Another Section","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"MC Hammer v0r1","title":"MC Hammer v0r1","text":"Pages = [\r\n    \"sec2/page1.md\",\r\n    \"sec2/page2.md\",\r\n    \"sec2/page3.md\"\r\n    ]\r\nDepth = 2","category":"page"},{"location":"#Index-1","page":"MC Hammer v0r1","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"MC Hammer v0r1","title":"MC Hammer v0r1","text":"","category":"page"}]
