Things to remember
---------------------------
1.) When you add a function, dont forget to export in in the main file
2.) Documentation Docstrings must can't have line spaces between description and function, otherwise text wont show up

---------------------------------
* MetaLogs
* BP : Use print to List Outputs for use with graph and stats functions
* Create a Percentile reporting function that supports Percentiles, Quantiles, Deciles and quintiles
* BP for Modeling : create functions for all repeated logic
* Correlation has to be done for all groups of simulated vars separately and recombined into sensitivity tables
* Changes to output means Sensitivity Chart
* Combined Expert Opinion
* Learning Curve Forecasts
* Ogive through empirical resampling
* Error Messages
* ADD Cumulative form (in Markowitz example)
